//This project is a javascript reference for the most important concepts learned via Codecademy
//It also includes some output from successfully completed code challenges

//The title of the file gives you an idea of what topic is being covered
//In order to run any of these examples I suggest using Firefox and switch to a new blank tab
//Open up a console [Ctrl + Shift + K]
//Then open up the javascript scratchpad [Shift + F4]
//Choose file option in scratchpad then choose file you want to view

//If you hit Run [Ctrl + R] whatever line has a console.log( ); runs the executed portion of the script
//The result displays at the bottom of your console output section
//You might have to read through and comment/uncomment certain portions to view different output

//It's just a reference so feel free to expirement

//I highly recommend Codeacademy's javascript track if you want to learn more about javacsript:
